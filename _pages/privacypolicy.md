# PRIVACY POLICY

This policy describes how we (referred in this policy as ‘Ting Radio’ or ‘we’, us’ and ‘our’) collect, use, process and share information that Ting Radio collects about you.
If you have any concerns about this privacy policy you should not use our apps or other Services.

## 1- Why Do we Collect data ?

Like most of the other app publishers, we needs to perform some R&D, analysis and marketing tasks. We explain here the reasons why we and our partners may collect data :

### To provide our products and services

For example, we need to know for which location, which time & date you want some weather forecasts. Similarly, if you use our search tool, we need to process your query in order to provide the matching results worldwide.

### To improve our services and develop new ones

We need to analyze the behaviour of our users in our apps. Most of the time, we do this by analyzing aggregated data. For example, this will help us understand if the user interface of the app should be improved, if some people get lost in a workflow, if we should add additional instructions etc... This can also help us know the frequency of use, the duration of sessions etc...

### To find and fix bugs

The data we collect can also help us to find and fix bugs thanks to technical crashlogs.

### To send notifications

If you agree to receive notifications, we'll need to retrieve some identifier in order to push the notications to your device. We make our best to only send valuable notifications.

### Legal uses

We may use your data for legal matters or if required by authorities, as permitted by any applicable law.

## 2- Data that may be collected

### App usage

Examples: navigation inside the app, actions in the app such as clicks on buttons, duration of sessions, frequency of use, locations, queries...

### Technical Data

Examples: IP address (partially anonymized), device country or language, device screen size, operating system and version...

### GPS location

When we collect your precise geolocation data (subject to your consent), we do so to provide you with our location-related products and services, for example to provide you with the best stations for your location. Your location is approximated before being used. 

### Messages

If you contact us, for instance by email, we may keep a record of that correspondence.
Your interactions with us on our social media channels.  

## 3- Changes to our privacy policy and practices

We will post any adjustments to the Privacy Policy on this web page, and the revised version will be effective when it is posted. If you are concerned about how your information is used, then bookmark this page and read this Privacy Policy periodically.
From time to time, we may desire to use or disclose Personal Information for uses not previously disclosed in our Privacy Policy. If our practices change regarding previously collected information in a way that would be materially less restrictive than stated in the version of this Privacy Policy in effect at the time we collected the information, then we will make reasonable efforts to provide notice and obtain consent prior to any such uses as may be required by law.
